    <h2>Card Examples</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Cards have become widely used in recent years. They're are a great way to contain and organize information, while also setting up predictable expectations for the user. With so much content to display at once, and often so little screen realestate, cards have fast become the design pattern of choice for many companies, including the likes of Google, Twitter, and Spotify..

				<p>For mobile experiences, Cards make it easy to display the same information visually across many different screen sizes. They allow for more control, are flexible, and can even be animated. Cards are usually placed on top of one another, but they can also be used like a "page" and swiped between, left and right.
